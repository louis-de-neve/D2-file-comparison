Designed for use after Montevens unpacker https://github.com/MontagueM/DestinyUnpacker
all my folders are straight on my D drive
havent checked the generate new list function in generator.py, am waiting for another update before i bother (probably wednesday)

requires 2 folders within the location specified by file_temp in settings.py
ones called "new", the other is "old"
the other locations referenced in settings are straight on my D drive - they are where the unpacker has dumped the bin files (in subfolders)
@ me on discord tadpolefeet#5106 if u need any help - ik i am a messy coder.
